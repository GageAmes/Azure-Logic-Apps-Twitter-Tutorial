# Subscribing to Tweets using Azure Logic Apps
#### Gage Ames (gage@gageames.com)
A tutorial for using [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/) to monitor recent tweets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com). The app sends an email notification to subscribers when new tweets are posted matching a search term.

## Technologies Used
- [Azure Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/) - Manage subscriptions, monitor tweets, and send email notifications to subscribers
- [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/) - Store persistent data like subscriptions

## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription
  - If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
  - If you're a student, you can [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students) without requiring a credit card at sign-up.
- An email account (Office 365 or Outlook for all features, Gmail if approval emails are not required)
- A [Twitter](https://twitter.com) account
- A web browser
- [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) (optional, but recommended for working with Azure Table Storage)

    ![](doc/images/create-table-screenshot.png)

## Configure the TwitterSubscriptionManager Logic App
This Logic App will accept subscribe and unsubscribe requests from users to/from a Twitter search term of their choosing. It will also verify the request was intentional by sending a verification email to the user prior to honoring their request.

![Logic App Designer view of the final TwitterSubscriptionManager Logic App](doc/images/subscription-manager-logic-app-designer.png)

### Configure the trigger for the TwitterSubscriptionManager Logic App
Every Logic App must start with a trigger, which fires when a specific event happens or when a specific condition is met. Each time the trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a Logic App instance that starts and runs your workflow.
1. From the main Azure menu, choose **Resource groups** > **TwitterLogicAppSample**.
1. Choose the **TwitterSubscriptionManager** Logic App that was created earlier.
1. The Logic Apps Designer will open and show a page with an introduction video and commonly used triggers. Under **Start with a common trigger**, choose **When a HTTP request is received**.
1. Use the **Save** button at the top of the screen to save the Logic App. Notice that a unique URL to trigger your Logic App was populated in the **HTTP POST URL** box. Your Logic App workflow will be triggered when a `POST` request is received at this URL.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-http-trigger-screenshot.png)

### Configure the parameters for the HTTP trigger
Your Logic App will need some information from the user to subscribe/unsubscribe them to/from a Twitter search term or hashtag. Namely, we'll need the email address of the subscriber, the search term, and whether the request is to subscribe or unsubscribe.
1. In the **When a HTTP request is received** trigger, click the **Edit** link next to **Using the default values for the parameters**. In the box that appears, we'll provide a JSON schema of the request format our Logic App should expect.
    1. Under the **Request Body JSON Schema** box, click the **Use sample payload to generate schema** link.
    1. In the **Enter or paste a sample JSON payload** dialog, paste the JSON below.
        ```json
        {
          "action": "subscribe",
          "email": "example@example.com",
          "term": "#microsoft"
        }
        ```
    1. Choose **Done**.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-request-schema-screenshot.png)

1. Save the Logic App.

### Send an approval email to validate the request
1. Choose **+ New step** in the Logic Apps Designer.
1. Under **Choose an action**, enter "send approval email" as your filter. From the actions list, select the **Send approval email** action for the email provider that you want.
    1. To filter the actions list to a specific app or service, you can select that app or service first:
        * For personal Microsoft accounts, select **Outlook.com**.
        * For Office 365 work or school accounts, select **Office 365 Outlook**.
        > The Gmail service does not support sending approval emails. If you only have a Gmail account, you can still use the **Send an email** action but your Logic App will not be able to receive responses to the email.
1. If asked for credentials, sign in to your email account so that Logic Apps can create a connection to your email account.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-email-connection-screenshot.png)

1. In the **Send approval email** action, specify the data that you want the email to include.
    1. Click inside the **To** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Choose **email** from the **Dynamic content** tab under the **When a HTTP request is received** heading. This will use the email address provided in the body of the HTTP request that triggered the workflow.
    1. If you like, edit the **Subject** of the email. You can include other parameters from the HTTP request using the dynamic content dialog. For example, you may want to change the subject to "Please approve <*action*> request for notifications about <*term*> tweets" where the <*action*> and <*term*> strings are replaced with the parameter values from the HTTP request.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-send-approval-email-screenshot.png)

1. Save the Logic App.

### Check if the request was approved
After the approval email is sent, the Logic App will wait for the user to click either the "Approve" or "Reject" link in the email. Once the user clicks one of those links, the Logic App will need to determine what to do next based on the response.
1. Choose **+ New step** in the Logic Apps Designer.
1. Under **Choose an action**, enter "condition" as your filter. From the actions list, choose the **Condition** Control action.
1. In the **Condition** action, populate the tree of conditions to evaluate.
    1. Leave the **And** drop down as is.
    1. Click inside the **Choose a value** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Choose **SelectedOption** from the **Dynamic content** tab under the **Send approval email** heading.
    1. Leave the value of the **is equal to** condition unchanged.
    1. In the **Choose a value** box, enter **Approve**.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-condition-screenshot.png)

1. Save the Logic App.

### Check if the request was for subscribing or unsubscribing
Once the request is approved the Logic App will need to perform the requested action (subscribe or unsubscribe the user). In this step, we'll determine which action to perform.
1. Choose **Add an action** within the **If true** block below the **Condition** in the Logic Apps Designer.
1. Under **Choose an action**, enter "switch" as your filter. From the actions list, choose the **Switch** Control action.
1. In the **Switch** action, populate the **On** value to tell the control action what value should be used to determine the next step.
    1. Click inside the **On** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Choose **action** from the **Dynamic content** tab under the **When a HTTP request is received** heading.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-switch-screenshot.png)

1. Below the **Switch** action, locate the **Case** block. Populate the **Equals** box with the text `subscribe`.
1. Click the **(+)** button between the **Case** block and the **Default** block. A **Case 2** block will be added.
1. Inside the **Case 2** block, populate the **Equals** box with the text `unsubscribe`.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-cases-screenshot.png)

    > If you like, you can rename these case blocks using the **Rename** option within the **&middot;&middot;&middot;** menu of each block.
1. Save the Logic App.

### Add an entry to the subscriptions table if the request was to subscribe
1. Choose **Add an action** within the **Case** block containing "Equals subscribe."
1. Under **Choose an action**, enter "insert or replace" as your filter. From the actions list, choose the **Insert or Replace Entity** Azure Table Storage action.
1. In the **Insert or Replace Entity** action, specify the table and the entity to insert or replace.
    1. You may be prompted for a Storage Account connection
        1. In the **Connection Name** box, provide a name like **TwitterLogicAppStorage**.
        1. Choose the **Storage Account** created earlier, **<*your-name*>twitterdata**.
        1. Click **Create**.

        ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-storage-account-connection-screenshot.png)

    1. Once the connection is created, choose **subscriptions** from the **Table** drop down.
    1. Click inside the **Partition Key** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Switch to the **Expression** tab and enter `uriComponent(toLower(triggerBody()['email']))` into the expression box. Click **OK** to set the expression as the partition key value.
        > This expression converts the email field from the `POST` request to lower case and then [URI-encodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) it. Converting to lower case will ensure that the user can unsubscribe easily later without the need to use the exact casing as when they subscribed. The encoding is necessary in case the user enters a character that is not permitted in partition keys or row keys, such as `#`.
    1. Click inside the **Row Key** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Switch to the **Expression** tab and enter `uriComponent(toLower(triggerBody()['term']))` into the expression box. Click **OK** to set the expression as the row key value.
    1. In the **Entity** box, enter the JSON below.
        ```json
        {
          "LastTweetId": ""
        }
        ```
        > The `LastTweetId` property will be used to track the most recent tweet our Logic App found that matches the provided search term. It will simplify determining which tweets are "new" later.

    ![](doc/images/twitter-subscription-manager-add-insert-entity-screenshot.png)

1. Save the Logic App.
    > You can read more about partition keys, row keys, and Azure Table Storage in general [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/table-storage-design-guide).

### Remove an entry from the subscriptions table if the request was to unsubscribe
1. Choose **Add an action** within the **Case 2** block containing "Equals unsubscribe."
1. Under **Choose an action**, enter "delete entity" as your filter. From the actions list, choose the **Delete Entity** Azure Table Storage action.
1. In the **Delete Entity** action, specify the table and the entity to delete.
    1. Choose **subscriptions** from the **Table** drop down.
    1. Click inside the **Partition Key** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Switch to the **Expression** tab and enter `uriComponent(toLower(triggerBody()['email']))` into the expression box. Click **OK** to set the expression as the partition key value.
    1. Click inside the **Row Key** box. The dynamic content dialog will appear. Switch to the **Expression** tab and enter `uriComponent(toLower(triggerBody()['term']))` into the expression box. Click **OK** to set the expression as the row key value.
    1. Leave the **ETag** box empty.
